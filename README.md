## DESCRIPTION
### Disclaimer: The dataset used and its application case are fictional, however, they mirror real life scenarios and problems which can be faced by real life data analysts in real life companies.
Parch and Posey is a company that deals with the sale of three distinct paper types to its clients. The Parch and Posey dataset contains 5 tables with varying number of columns, all linked via primary keys and foreign keys. Each table contains important information on customers, their orders and its characteristics, their purchase regions, assigned sales representatives, and the route from which they were integrated into the company. 
The tables include accounts, orders, region, sales_reps and web_events.
The entity relationship diagram is attached to aid the visualizing of the table names, column names in each table as well as the relationships existing amongst the tables being analysed.
